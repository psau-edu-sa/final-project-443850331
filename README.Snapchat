Snapchat is a popular app that lets people send photos and videos that disappear after they're seen. 
It's known for its fun filters that can change your look, like giving you dog ears or a funny hat. 
You can also share stories that last for 24 hours, chat with friends, and see news or entertainment on its Discover feature. 
It's especially popular with younger people who enjoy sharing moments of their day without worrying about them staying online forever.
In this project we will talk about it.
